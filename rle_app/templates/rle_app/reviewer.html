        <h3>Super-resolution ophthalmoscopy: Virtually structured detection for resolution improvement in retinal imaging</h3></a>

        <p class="paragraph">The retina is responsible for capturing photons, converting light energy to bioelectric signal, and preliminary visual information processing. Given its delicate function, the retina can be frequently targeted by eye diseases that can cause vision loss and even blindness. Retinal examination plays one essential role in eye disease detection and treatment assessment. In addition to traditional fundus photography, multiple imaging modalities such as scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (SLO), fluorescein angiography (FA), optical coherence tomography (OCT) and OCT angiography (OCTA)4 have been established to enable quantitative assessment of the retina. In principle, a better imaging resolution corresponds to a better opportunity to reveal subtle abnormalities at the early stage of eye diseases. Therefore, spatial resolution of retinal imaging is never more than enough to improve eye disease detection and treatment assessment. VSD provides a new pathway to achieve super-resolution SLO for high resolution imaging of the retina. In conjunction with rapid line-scan imaging and digital registration to minimize the effect of eye movements, VSD enabled resolution improvement for unambiguous observation of individual retinal photoreceptors without the involvement of AO.</p>

        <h3>The prognostic value of peripheral retinal nonperfusion in diabetic retinopathy using ultra-widefield fluorescein angiography</h3></a>

        <p class="paragraph">Specifically, the use of UW fluorescein angiography (UWFA) has emerged as a powerful tool in DR. It allows the quantification of areas of retinal nonperfusion, in particular peripheral nonperfusion (PNP). Measuring the extent of PNP was shown to be useful in identifying patients at risk of progression to proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR). Similarly, PNP was demonstrated to be a strong predictor of central and macular ischemia. Higher amounts of retinal nonperfusion are seen in patients with more severe retinopathy. Increased CNP is associated with macular thickening and subsequent vision loss. Having predominantly PNP was independently associated with worse visual acuity, regardless of macular thickness</p>

        <h3>Widefield imaging with Clarus fundus camera vs slit lamp fundus examination in assessing patients referred from the National Health Service diabetic retinopathy screening programme</h3></a>

        <p class="paragraph">The slit lamp examination is a basic ophthalmologic examination method that allows the eye tissue to be examined through an optical section by cutting each tissue of the eye with a slit light beam. By using a light bulb with a vertical filament as a light source and reducing a circular light beam to a square, the width and length of the circular light beam can be arbitrarily adjusted, and the image can be enlarged up to about 40 times. Studies have shown that examination with Optos ultra-widefield fundus imaging is reliable in detecting diabetic retinopathy and compares well to slit lamp fundus examination, yielding a sensitivity and specificity of 73% and 96%, respectively for detecting proliferative diabetic retinopathy. This study proposes having a low threshold of bringing back patients for slit lamp examination if the peripheral retina view on the Clarus photo is hazy with suspicious retinal haemorrhage or if the other eye has proliferative disease. Virtual clinics could indeed help to meet the increased demand for hospital eye clinic appointments as Lee et al. showed that twice as many patients can be seen in virtual clinics compared to slit lamp examination clinics in the same time period.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Measuring visual field loss is a key component of an eye examination. It is a particular cornerstone of glaucoma assessments, where optic nerve damage typically results in asymptomatic visual field loss that can only be detected by perimetric examination. A portable, inexpensive, and user-friendly device would allow for more effective visual field screening, particularly in resource-poor or hard to reach communities. This in turn could help to improve detection rates for diseases such as glaucoma (which are currently poor), and may lead to fewer patients presenting to hospital eye service with already advanced visual field loss.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Corneal staining may be graded over the entire cornea as a whole, or in each of five corneal zones: superior, inferior, nasal, temporal, central. Several publications have described corneal staining in subjects with and without dry eye to be more common in the inferior or vertical aspect of the cornea rather than the horizontal. Based on these results, in the presence of dry eye symptoms, the inferior zone typically presents the most severe grade of corneal staining. This knowledge is valuable when developing a strategy to treat dry eye signs as the inferior corneal zone has the highest grade of staining thus has the potential to exhibit the greatest reduction in staining post-treatment.</p>
